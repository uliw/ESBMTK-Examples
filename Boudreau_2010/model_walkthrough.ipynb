    "The model consists of three ocean boxes, one for the low-latitude ocean areas, one for the high-latitude ocean areas, and one box for the deep ocean. Additionally, it has a box representing the atmosphere. \n\n![img](./model_geometry-crop.png \"Empty\")\n\nThe model assumes that there is no organic and inorganic export flux from the high latitude to the deep ocean box and that the particulate organic matter flux from the low latitude to the deep ocean box (F5) is fully remineralized and has no effect on alkalinity. \n\nThe carbonate export flux (F6) is partly dissolved and partly buried (F2), where the partitioning between F2 and F6 depends on the carbon speciation in the deep box. The model uses a fixed rain ratio where F5/F6 = 0.3. Alkalinity and dissolved organic carbon are replenished via a constant weathering flux (F1). The model does not consider phosphor cycling. Thermohaline circulation (F3) and mixing between the high-latitude and deep ocean boxes (F4) redistribute the dissolved species, and gas exchange with the atmosphere balances the concentration of dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> between the low-latitude and high-latitude boxes (F7 & F8). \n\n"

The automatic connection instance creation relies however on a strict naming scheme for the dictionary key.

The parsing process relies on the presence of the sting `_to_` and `@`.  Note that the `species_list` list was returned by the  `initialize_reservoirs()` function above.

    "Boudreau et al. 2010 assume that primary productivity is fixed and that the remineralization efficiency for organic matter (OM) is 100%. Furthermore, they assume that OM export does not affect alkalinity.\nBelow we use the quantity operator `Q_` to convert the OM export flux into model units, it is however permissible to also supply a numeric value instead (e.g., 200E12). As before we use a dictionary to define the respective fluxes. There are however a few notable differences:\n\n-   The connection type is now `Fixed` which means it is a constant rate.\n-   We use the `bp` keyword, which means to bypass the (in this case) sink. This is needed because carbonate dissolution/precipitation is calculated by a function (`carbonate_system_2()`, see below). As such the below setup removes DIC and TA from the surface box but does not add them to the deep box. Rather, the TA and DIC contributions to the deep box are handled by `carbonate_system_2()`.\n\n"

These equations are handled by the `carbonate_system_1()` ([H<sup>+</sup>] and [(CO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>aq</sub>]) `carbonate_system_2()`  (dissolution flux, [H<sup>+</sup>] and snowline depth) functions.  These functions are added to the model description with two helper functions  `add_carbonate_system_1()` and  `add_carbonate_system_2()`. For CS1, we only need to provide the box names, whereas for CS2, one also needs to specify the source box, the amount of CaCO<sub>3</sub> that dissolves above the saturation horizon (&alpha;), the depth of the shelf (z<sub>0</sub>) as well as the CaCO<sub>3</sub> export flux.\n\nTo get the name of the CaCO<sub>3</sub> export flux we use the `flux_summary()` method to query the Model definition for all fluxes with a given id (here `PIC_DIC`).
