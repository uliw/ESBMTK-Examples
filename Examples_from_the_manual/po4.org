* A simple P-cycle model 
A simple model of the marine P-cycle would consider the delivery of P from weathering, the burial of P in the sediments, the thermohaline transport of dissolved PO_4 as well as the export of P in the form of sinking organic matter (POP). The concentration in the respective surface and deep water boxes is then the sum of the respective fluxes (see Fig. 1). The model parameters are taken from Glover 2011, Modeling Methods in the Marine Sciences.

If we define equations that control the export of particulate P (F_{POP}) as a fraction of the upwelling P (F_u), and the burial of P (F_b) as a fraction of (F_{POP}), we express this model as coupled ordinary differential equations (ODE, or initial value problem):

\[
\frac{d[PO_{4}]_{S}}{dt} = \frac{F_w + F_u - F_d - F_{POP}}{V_S}
\]

and for the deep ocean, 

\[
\frac{d[PO_{4}]_{D}}{dt}= \frac{F_{POP} + F_d - F_u - F_b}{V_D}
\]

** Implementing the P-cycle with ESBMTK
While ESBMTK provides abstractions to efficiently define complex models, the following section will use the basic ESBMTK classes to define the above model. While quite verbose, it demonstrates the design philosophy behind ESBMTK. More complex approaches are described further down. For the sake of brevity, the following code box contains the entire model code. For a more detailed walk-through, please see  https://esbmtk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/manual-1.html#a-simple-example
